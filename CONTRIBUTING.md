# How to Contribute

Interested in contributing to the Airbnb Ruby style guide? Awesome! Here are
some guidelines to help you out.

**Setting expectations**: Although we love hearing from others who are invested
in Ruby style, ultimately this style guide is used to dictate the code style
*within Airbnb*. It isn't a community style guide, and as such we may reject
issues or PRs that simply don't fit our internal engineering needs.

## Pull Requests

PRs to the style guide should include a description of the proposal, including
examples of what "good" and "bad" code would look like under the new rule, as
well as a rationale for the rule in question. The description of the rule and
the examples belong in `README.md`. If the rationale is anything other than "for
consistency", it should go into a corresponding section in `rationales.md`.
Style rules that are purely about consistency do not need rationales.

Individual rules should include, after the description of the rule, a link to
that rule, and, if a rationale is being added to `rationales.md`, a link to the
detailed rationale.
